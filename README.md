Fine-Tuning LLMs on Custom Text Data
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) on custom textual datasets using Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets libraries. It is tailored for experimentation and educational purposes, particularly around domain-specific adaptation of pre-trained models.

📂 Project Overview
The notebook walks through the end-to-end process of:

Preparing and cleaning raw .txt data

Loading data into a format compatible with Hugging Face datasets

Applying PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques such as LoRA

Managing GPU/Colab setup for efficient training

Running lightweight fine-tuning suitable for limited hardware

🧠 Core Concepts
Custom Dataset Loading: How to ingest and structure raw .txt data for use with Hugging Face models

LoRA and PEFT: Using lightweight adapters to reduce computational cost during fine-tuning

Tokenization: Applying appropriate tokenizers based on the chosen model (e.g., LLaMA, GPT, etc.)

GPU Utilization: Handling CUDA setup and checking resource availability in Colab

Hugging Face Ecosystem: Seamless integration of transformers, datasets, and accelerate for model management

🧠 Model Used
Model Name: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

Type: Causal Language Model (Chat Optimized)

Source: Hugging Face Model Hub

Loading Configuration:

4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes

PEFT integration with LoRA for efficient training

Tokenizer: LlamaTokenizer from the same model family

This model was chosen for its balance between capability and fine-tuning feasibility on mid-range GPUs such as those available in Google Colab.

⚠️ Prerequisites
Hugging Face account (for downloading pre-trained models)

GPU-enabled runtime (e.g., Colab Pro or equivalent)

Familiarity with Python and Transformers

🚀 How to Use
Upload your .txt files to the data/ folder.

Run the notebook cell by cell in a Colab environment.

Monitor GPU usage and training logs to evaluate performance.

Export or share the fine-tuned model via Hugging Face Hub or local storage.

📌 Notes
Ensure your .txt files are formatted with one sample per line for best results.

This project uses LoRA-based fine-tuning, which is optimal for resource-limited environments.
